# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I?
My name is Quentin Le Bosser, I'm a marketer, entrepreneur, and self-taught programmer who happens to have a strong passion for technology and development. Although my journey in the world of coding is relatively new, I have been able to leverage my understanding of HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript to create aesthetically pleasing and functional websites.

## My work
ðŸ”­ My previous projects mainly involve website development, with a particular emphasis on front-end design. I believe that a well-designed UI/UX can speak volumes about a brand, and this is a concept I strive to incorporate into my work.

## My focus
ðŸŒ± I'm interested in expanding my knowledge in the realm of machine learning, front-end development, and web applications. I'm always eager to learn and improve, and I'm constantly seeking out opportunities to apply new concepts and technologies to my projects.

## My philosophy
ðŸ’¡ My approach to coding? I believe in keeping my code clean, readable, and well-organized. I hold the opinion that well-written code not only facilitates the development process, but also encourages collaborative efforts and ensures the sustainability of a project.

## My background
ðŸ“« As a marketer and entrepreneur, I have a broader perspective that extends beyond coding. I bring unique insights from my primary field to my development projects, creating a blend of aesthetic sense, technical skills, and business acumen.

## Beyond
ðŸš€ Even though my main profession is in marketing and entrepreneurship, I've found a strong passion for coding and technology. This unconventional journey has helped me grow and understand the digital world from a unique perspective.
